# Modularization
Modularization is a software design technique that involves breaking a program into smaller, independent modules or components. This can make a program easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

In C, modularization is typically achieved using functions. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program.

To create a function in C, you use the `function` keyword, followed by the function name, the parameter list enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in braces. For example:

```C
void print_message() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

This is a simple function named print_message that does not take any arguments and does not return a value. It simply prints a message to the screen using the printf function.

To call a function from another part of your program, you use the function name followed by the argument list enclosed in parentheses. For example:
```C
int main() {
  print_message();
  return 0;
}
```

Functions can also take arguments and return values. For example:
```C
int sum(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
This is a function named sum that takes two integer arguments, a and b, and returns the sum of these values. To call this function and get the sum of two numbers, you can use code like this:
```C
int main() {
  int x = 3, y = 4;
  int result = sum(x, y);
  printf("The sum of %d and %d: %d",x,y,result);
```
