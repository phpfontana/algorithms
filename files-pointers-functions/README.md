## 2. Modularization, pointers, and files

Modularization, pointers, and files are crucial concepts for writing efficient and maintainable code. Modularization refers to the practice of breaking your code up into smaller, self-contained units called modules or functions. This allows you to write and test each unit separately, and then combine them to form a larger program.

Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They can be used to directly manipulate the data stored in memory, which can be useful for optimizing the performance of your code.

Files are used to store data permanently on a computer's storage device. You can read from and write to files in your code, which allows you to save and load data from your program.

In this section, you will learn about modularization, pointers, and files, and how to use them in your code.
