## 3. Dynamic memory allocation

Dynamic memory allocation refers to the practice of allocating memory for data on the heap, rather than on the stack. This allows your program to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory as needed, which can be useful for optimizing the performance of your code.

In this section, you will learn about dynamic memory allocation, and how to use it in your code. You will also learn about common algorithms and techniques for working with dynamic memory allocation.
