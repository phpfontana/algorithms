## 1. Arrays, strings, and structs

Arrays, strings, and structs are important data structures that are commonly used in programming. Arrays allow you to store a collection of data in a single, contiguous block of memory. Strings are used to represent text, and structs allow you to group related data together into a single, cohesive unit.

In this section, you will learn how to declare and manipulate arrays, strings, and structs in your code. You will also learn about common algorithms and techniques for working with these data structures.
