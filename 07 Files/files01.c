/*

01 Basic File Operations

Operating system contain services which we can use to read
and write information on disk.

Those servvices are:
- Open: the os will find the file and prepare it on the buffer.

- Read: the os will read the buffer.

- Write: the os will modify the file. The initial modification will be
made on the buffer and later transferred to the disk.

- Close: closing the file will free the buffer.
